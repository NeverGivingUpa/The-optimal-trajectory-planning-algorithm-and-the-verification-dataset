# The-optimal-trajectory-planning-algorithm-and-the-verification-dataset
This algorithm can quickly plan the optimal trajectory for the vehicle in complex scenarios. The algorithm has been verified in 500 simulated scenarios. 

We temporarily upload 100 random scenarios from the dataset to demonstrate the simulation scenarios, simulation process, and simulation results.

This scenario dataset will be made public later along with the project content, forming an open dataset, to facilitate researchers to validate their own algorithms.

In the scenarios in the dataset, all obstacles are randomly placed, and the vehicleâ€™s start and end poses are randomly generated. The gray convex polygons are simulated road obstacles and non-road areas. The red rectangles indicate the parking spaces in the parking lot, and the purple rectangles indicate the static vehicle obstacles on the parking spaces. The blue rectangles indicate the target position where the self-vehicle needs to be summoned.
