# The-optimal-trajectory-planning-algorithm-and-the-verification-dataset
This algorithm can quickly plan the optimal trajectory for the vehicle in complex scenarios. The algorithm has been verified in 500 simulated scenarios. 

We temporarily upload 100 random scenarios from the dataset to demonstrate the simulation scenarios, simulation process, and simulation results.

This scenario dataset will be made public later along with the project content, forming an open dataset, to facilitate researchers to validate their own algorithms.
